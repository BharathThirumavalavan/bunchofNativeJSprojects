                        A bicycle, also called a bike or cycle, is a human-powered or motor-powered, pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, having
                    two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other. A bicycle rider is called a cyclist, or bicyclist.
                    Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century in Europe, and by the early 21st century, more than 1 billion were in
                    existence.These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of individual
                    models produced. They are the principal means of transportation in many regions. They also provide a popular
                    form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys, general fitness, military and police applications,
                    courier services, bicycle racing, and bicycle stunts.

                <p>
                    A cliff is used to describe a vertical or almost vertical slope . It could be part of a mountain or be along coastlines
                    / rivers ( the walls of a canyon are cliffs) .
                    
                    Hill and Mountain are slightly subjective terms- though hill is something that doesn't rise more than a 100 200 metres
                    above the surroundings while mountains can rise much more than that anywhere upto a few km!
